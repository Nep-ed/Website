        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>At NepEd, our mission is to provide high-quality, accessible educational 
            content on a wide range of electrical engineering topics, including microcontrollers, 
            embedded programming, signal processing, PLCs, and hardware development. Whether you're 
            a student, hobbyist, or professional, we strive to bridge the gap between theory and 
            practical application through clear explanations, hands-on tutorials, and real-world 
            projects. Our goal is to inspire innovation, foster learning, and equip engineers with 
            the knowledge they need to excel in the ever-evolving world of electronics.</p>
