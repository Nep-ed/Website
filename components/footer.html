                <h3>About Neped</h3>
                <p>At NepEd, our mission is to provide high-quality, accessible educational 
                    content on a wide range of electrical engineering topics, including 
                    microcontrollers, embedded programming, signal processing, PLCs, and 
                    hardware development. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional, 
                    we strive to bridge the gap between theory and practical application through 
                    clear explanations, hands-on tutorials, and real-world projects. Our goal is 
                    to inspire innovation, foster learning, and equip engineers with the knowledge 
                    they need to excel in the ever-evolving world of electronics.</p>
